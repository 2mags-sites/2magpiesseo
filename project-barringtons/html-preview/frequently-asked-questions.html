                        <h3>How long after death does a funeral take place?</h3>
                        <p>Typically, funerals take place within 1-2 weeks, but this can vary. Factors include registration completion, venue availability, and family preferences. We'll work at your pace – there's no rush to make decisions.</p>

                        <h3>What's the difference between burial and cremation?</h3>
                        <p>Cremation involves the respectful reduction of the body to ashes, which can then be scattered, kept, or interred. Burial provides a permanent resting place in a cemetery or natural burial ground. Both can include a full funeral service. The choice is personal and may be influenced by wishes, beliefs, or practical considerations.</p>

                        <p>We typically send our invoice after the funeral and allow 30 days for payment. If you're waiting for funds from the estate or insurance, we can often extend this. We'll discuss payment options during our initial meeting.</p>

                    <div class="faq-item">

                    <div class="faq-item">
                        <h3>What can we do with the ashes?</h3>
                        <p>Options include scattering in a meaningful place (with permission if needed), interment in a cemetery or crematorium garden, keeping them at home in an urn, or dividing them among family members. Some choose to incorporate ashes into jewelry or other keepsakes.</p>

                    <div class="faq-item">
