          "content": "PRACTICES COMMITMENT TO RESULTS Fees and Charging Arrangements \u200b The first concern of most clients when seeking legal advice is cost. \u200b We have long been dissatisfied with hourly charge rates for the simple fact it lacks transparency and assurance to the client of the desired result. We work on retainer arrangements, fixed quotations for specific projects, and adjust fees to the complexity and amount of involvement, and ultimately the quality of the services provided. For SME\u2019s we advise from the outset what the cost will be for each stage of the process so that the client can assess the risk and decide in advance how far it wants to go in pursuing or defending a claim. It's important our clients know: \u200b We do not charge for each fee-earner depending on seniority; while partners charge higher fees than assistants or paralegals in general, the amount will be adjusted downward for simple or routine work. We do not use timesheets to calculate fees. Adjustments are made to fit the client's budget in special cases. \u200b All fees take into account whether or not the objective has been achieved to the client's satisfaction.

Read More New Era of Regulation A new era of regulation is upon us. Not just by governments, but also through the economic dominance of banks, large corporations, and the super giant social media, for more than a decade, regulatory initiatives claiming justification on the basis of the need to combat terrorism, or to prevent money-laundering, or tax-evasion (so-called CTF or AML or KYC) or privacy and data protection and even to support international economic sanctions, have been implemented around the world.
