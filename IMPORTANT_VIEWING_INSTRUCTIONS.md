# IMPORTANT: How to View the Generated PHP Website

## The Issue You Encountered

When accessing pages without `.php` extension (e.g., `/commercial-litigation`), you see the homepage content instead of the specific page content. This is because:

1. **PHP's built-in server** (`php -S localhost:8000`) doesn't support `.htaccess` rewrite rules
2. **Clean URLs** (without .php) require special handling

## Solution: Two Ways to View the Website

### Option 1: Access Pages WITH .php Extension (Recommended for Testing)

Start the server normally:
```bash
cd output/demo_20250913_111149
php -S localhost:8000
```

Then access pages WITH the .php extension:
- ✅ http://localhost:8000/index.php
- ✅ http://localhost:8000/commercial-litigation.php
- ✅ http://localhost:8000/family-law.php
- ✅ http://localhost:8000/divorce-attorney.php
- ✅ http://localhost:8000/about.php
- ✅ http://localhost:8000/contact.php

**This works perfectly and shows unique content for each page!**

### Option 2: Use Apache/XAMPP for Clean URLs (Production-Ready)

For clean URLs to work properly (without .php), you need a real web server:

1. **Install XAMPP** (or WAMP/MAMP)
2. **Copy the website** to `htdocs` folder
3. **Access via Apache**: http://localhost/your-site/commercial-litigation

Apache will properly handle the `.htaccess` file and clean URLs will work.

## Why This Happens

The generated website includes:
- ✅ **Unique content for each page** (verified and working)
- ✅ **Auto-detection of page names** in PHP files
- ✅ **Clean URL support** via .htaccess (for Apache)

However, PHP's built-in development server:
- ❌ Doesn't support .htaccess files
- ❌ Requires special router scripts for clean URLs
- ✅ Works perfectly with .php extensions

## For Production Deployment

When you deploy to a real web host:
1. Upload all files via FTP
2. The `.htaccess` file will work automatically
3. Clean URLs will work without any changes
4. Users can access `/commercial-litigation` (no .php needed)

## Summary

- **For local testing**: Use `.php` extensions
- **For production**: Clean URLs work automatically on Apache/Nginx
- **All pages have unique content** - verified and working!

The system is working correctly - it's just a limitation of PHP's built-in server!
