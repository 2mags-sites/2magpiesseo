a new website which is a partnership with tourxgolf, but launching a 4 bay Trackman experience for golfers who are serious about investing in their game improvement. you can rent a bay by the hour. please fully research trackman, all the features, the fact that there's apps you can use to track your progress etc. I want a 3 page microsite which will sit within the existing website, but with its own navigation and a clear 'back to tourxgolf' button. I need you to suggest the information architecture, write the copy, and suggest what goes where on each page. use placeholder images for now until we get actual images to use.
