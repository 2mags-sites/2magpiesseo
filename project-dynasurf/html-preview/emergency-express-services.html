                        <p>Our emergency line is staffed 24/7 with immediate response. We can typically arrange same-day collection throughout the UK and, depending on the repair required, often complete simple repairs within hours. Complex repairs may take longer but receive priority scheduling to minimise your downtime. We'll provide an accurate timeline immediately after assessment.</p>

                        <p>Emergency service includes priority charges for urgent collection, extended hours operation, and express delivery. These charges vary depending on the urgency and complexity of the repair. We provide transparent pricing upfront, and often the emergency charges are offset by the savings from reduced downtime. Many clients find the express service cost-effective compared to production losses.</p>

                        <p>Yes, where possible we can provide temporary repair solutions to get your equipment operational while permanent repairs are completed. This might include emergency seal replacement, temporary chrome plating, or expedited component manufacturing. We'll assess each situation and recommend the best approach to minimise your operational disruption.</p>

                    <div class="faq-answer">
                        <p>Absolutely. All emergency repairs carry the same 12-month warranty as our standard work, covering workmanship and components replaced during the repair. We never compromise on quality standards, even under emergency conditions. The only difference is the accelerated timeline, not the quality of work performed.</p>
