                        <p>In the UK, there's no legal timeframe for when a burial must occur. Typically, funerals take place within 1-2 weeks of death, but this can vary based on family wishes, registration requirements, and cemetery availability. Religious considerations may require sooner burial - we can accommodate urgent requirements and work with your timeline.</p>
