                        <p>Established in 1892, we began as a small family business dedicated to serving our local community with dignity and respect. Through five generations, we've maintained our founding principles while adapting to meet the changing needs of modern families.</p>
                        <p>Today, from our funeral home on Washway Road, we continue to provide the same personal, caring service that has earned the trust of thousands of families throughout Sale, Stretford, Altrincham, and Greater Manchester. Being independent and family-owned means we can focus entirely on what matters most - caring for you and your loved ones.</p>
