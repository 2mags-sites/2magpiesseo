                    <div class="faq-answer">
                        <p>Cremation is generally less expensive than burial as there's no need to purchase a grave plot or pay for grave digging. Crematorium fees vary by location but are typically lower than cemetery charges. However, the overall cost depends on your choices for the service, coffin, and any additional elements. We provide transparent pricing for all options.</p>

                        <p>Most crematorium chapels allow 30-45 minutes for a standard service, though extended times can be arranged if needed. This typically includes time for mourners to enter, the service itself, and the committal. Some families choose to hold a longer service at a church or other venue first, followed by a shorter committal at the crematorium.</p>
