                        <p>At Arthur Kershaw Funeral Services, we understand that not everyone wants or needs a traditional ceremony. Direct cremation allows families to say goodbye in their own way, perhaps holding a memorial service or celebration of life at a later date when they feel ready.</p>
                        <p>This increasingly popular choice offers simplicity and affordability while maintaining the dignity and respect your loved one deserves. Our professional team handles all arrangements with the same care and attention we've provided to families since 1892.</p>

                        <p>Direct cremation is a simple cremation without a funeral service or ceremony. Your loved one is cremated privately at a time arranged by us, without mourners present. It's sometimes called an unattended cremation or simple cremation. The ashes are then returned to you, allowing you to arrange any memorial in your own time and way.</p>
