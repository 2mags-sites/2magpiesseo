                        <p>There's no legal requirement for how quickly a funeral must take place, though it's usually within 1-3 weeks of death. We can arrange funerals within a few days if needed for religious reasons, or take longer if family need to travel. The main consideration is registering the death within 5 days.</p>

                    <div class="faq-answer">
                        <p>Yes, this is called direct cremation or direct burial. There's no ceremony at the crematorium or graveside - just the practical arrangements. Many families choose this and hold their own memorial service separately at a venue of their choice.</p>

                        What if the deceased left specific wishes about their funeral?

                    <div class="faq-answer">
                        <p>We always respect the deceased's wishes wherever possible. If they left written instructions, had a pre-paid plan, or expressed clear preferences to family, we'll work to honour these. However, family circumstances and practical considerations sometimes require adaptations.</p>

                        <p>Absolutely. We handle all funeral-related paperwork including crematorium applications, burial permits, newspaper notices, and liaison with officiants. We'll also guide you through death registration and can advise on other matters like telling banks and government departments.</p>

                    <div class="faq-answer">
                        <p>Yes, family members can act as bearers if they wish. We'll provide guidance on what's involved and ensure there are professional bearers as backup. Some families choose to have family bearers at one part of the service (like from the church) and our staff at another (into the crematorium).</p>
