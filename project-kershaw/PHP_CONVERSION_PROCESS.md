# PHP Conversion Process - CLARIFIED

## What We're Actually Doing

### Step 1: HTML Already Has Everything ✅
- All 20 HTML pages have COMPLETE content
- AI already read documentation and generated all text
- Content is final and ready
- NO new content generation needed

### Step 2: PHP Conversion is SIMPLE
For each HTML file:

1. **Extract common parts:**
   - Take header (navigation) → put in header.php
   - Take footer → put in footer.php
   
2. **Create PHP page:**
   ```php
   <?php 
   $page_title = "[Already in HTML]";
   $page_description = "[Already in HTML]";
   require 'includes/header.php';
   ?>
   
   [EXACT CONTENT FROM HTML - NO CHANGES]
   
   <?php require 'includes/footer.php'; ?>
   ```

3. **Add Schema.org in header.php:**
   - Read from same JSON files AI used
   - Generate structured data
   - That's it!

## What We DON'T Need

❌ **data-loader.php** - Overcomplicated
❌ **Content generation in PHP** - Already done in HTML
❌ **Complex PHP logic** - Content is static
❌ **Database** - Everything is in files

## What We DO Need

✅ **config.php** - Just phone/email for header/footer
✅ **header.php** - Navigation + Schema
✅ **footer.php** - Footer content
✅ **Each page.php** - Include header, paste content, include footer

## The Truth About Our Process

```
1. DOCUMENTATION PHASE
   ├── Scrape website
   ├── Create business-info.json
   ├── Create keyword-mapping.json
   └── Create BUSINESS_COMPLETE.md

2. HTML GENERATION PHASE (AI reads docs)
   ├── AI reads all documentation
   ├── AI generates complete content
   └── Creates 20 complete HTML files

3. PHP CONVERSION PHASE (Current)
   ├── Extract header/footer to includes
   ├── Add Schema.org (from same JSON)
   └── Keep all content exactly as-is
```

## Example Conversion

### Original HTML (index.html):
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>Arthur Kershaw...</title>
    [meta tags]
</head>
<body>
    [navigation]
    
    <section class="hero">
        <h1>Compassionate Funeral Services in Sale</h1>
        <p>Family-owned funeral directors...</p>
    </section>
    
    [footer]
</body>
</html>
```

### Converted PHP (index.php):
```php
<?php
$page_title = "Arthur Kershaw...";
$page_description = "Family-owned funeral...";
require 'includes/header.php';
?>

<section class="hero">
    <h1>Compassionate Funeral Services in Sale</h1>
    <p>Family-owned funeral directors...</p>
</section>

<?php require 'includes/footer.php'; ?>
```

## That's It!

The PHP conversion is just:
1. Split HTML into includes
2. Add Schema.org
3. Done

No complex data loading needed because all content already exists!
