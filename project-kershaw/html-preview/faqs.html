                    <div class="faq-answer">
                        <p>Funeral costs vary greatly depending on your choices. Our services range from £995 for direct cremation to over £5,000 for elaborate traditional funerals. Most families spend £2,500-£3,500. We provide detailed written quotes with no hidden charges and can work with most budgets. See our <a href="/funeral-costs">detailed pricing page</a> for more information.</p>

                    <div class="faq-answer">
                        <p>There's no legal time limit, though funerals typically take place 1-3 weeks after death. You must register the death within 5 days, but the funeral can be later if needed for family to travel or for other reasons. We can arrange very quick funerals (within 2-3 days) if required for religious reasons.</p>

                    <div class="faq-answer">
                        <p>Usually the surviving spouse or civil partner, then adult children, then parents, then siblings. However, we encourage families to work together. If there are disputes, we can suggest mediation. The person arranging the funeral is also responsible for the costs unless other arrangements are made.</p>

                        <p>No, it's not legally required, but it's highly recommended. Funeral directors handle complex legal paperwork, coordinate multiple services, and provide essential equipment and facilities. DIY funerals are possible but require significant time, knowledge, and stress during an already difficult time.</p>

                        What's the difference between burial and cremation?

                    <div class="faq-answer">
                        <p>Burial involves placing the coffin in the ground at a cemetery, where it remains permanently. Cremation involves the coffin being placed in a cremator, and the ashes are returned to you. Burial typically costs more due to grave purchase costs. Both can have the same type of funeral service beforehand.</p>

                    <div class="faq-answer">
                        <p>A funeral service typically includes music, readings, prayers or reflections, and a eulogy celebrating the person's life. The format depends on your wishes - it can be religious, humanist, or civil. Services usually last 20-30 minutes at a crematorium, longer in churches. We'll help you plan every detail.</p>

                    <div class="faq-answer">
                        <p>Yes, this is called a memorial service. It's often chosen when the body has been donated to medical science, or when families want a direct cremation followed by their own celebration of life. Memorial services can be held anywhere and at any time after the death.</p>

                        <p>Absolutely. We encourage families to make the service personal. This might include favourite music, photos, special flowers, particular readings, displaying hobbies or interests, or involving grandchildren.

                        <p>No, we believe in complete transparency. Our written quotes include all our professional services and itemise third-party costs like crematorium fees. The only additional costs would be extras you choose to add later, and we'll always discuss these with you first.</p>

                        <p>Yes, we have experience with all major faiths and many cultural traditions. We work closely with local clergy, imams, rabbis, and other religious leaders. We understand requirements around timing, burial methods, preparation of the body, and service formats for different religions.</p>

                        What if we want a non-religious funeral?

                    <div class="faq-answer">
                        <p>Absolutely fine - we arrange many non-religious funerals. You can choose a humanist celebrant, a civil celebrant, or have family members conduct the service themselves. The focus is on celebrating the person's life and achievements rather than religious content.</p>

                    <div class="faq-answer">
                        <p>Yes, most venues can play any music you choose - pop songs, classical pieces, jazz, or anything meaningful to your loved one. We can arrange live musicians if preferred. The only limitation is volume levels at some crematoria, but we'll advise on what works best at each venue.</p>

                        <p>We offer several environmentally-friendly options including woodland burials, biodegradable coffins made from cardboard or wicker, and natural burial grounds. Cremation is also considered environmentally friendly. We can discuss all options and help you choose what aligns with your values.</p>
