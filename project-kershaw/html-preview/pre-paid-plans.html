                    <div class="faq-answer">
                        <p>Yes, absolutely. Your money is held in an independent trust fund, not by us. This means it's completely secure and protected. The trust is regulated and your money can only be released to carry out your funeral. If we were ever unable to provide your funeral, another funeral director would be appointed to carry out your wishes.</p>

                        <p>Your plan is fully transferable. If you move elsewhere in the UK, we can arrange for a funeral director in your new area to provide the funeral. If you move abroad, the plan value can be refunded. The plan belongs to you and moves with you.</p>

                        <p>Yes. You have 30 days after purchase to cancel for a full refund. After this, you can still cancel but a cancellation fee applies. You can also change elements of your plan at any time - just contact us to discuss amendments. We want you to be completely happy with your arrangements.</p>
