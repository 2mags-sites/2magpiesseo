                        <h3>When Punctures Can Be Repaired</h3>
                        <p><strong>Repairable Punctures:</strong> Small holes in the tread area (up to 6mm diameter) caused by nails, screws, or similar objects. The puncture must be in the central 75% of the tread area for safe repair.</p>

                        <p><strong>Professional Assessment:</strong> We inspect the puncture location, size, and internal damage to determine if repair is safe. Factors include angle of penetration, tyre age, existing wear, and previous repairs.</p>

                        <p><strong>Safety Standards:</strong> We follow British Standard BS AU 159f guidelines for tyre repairs, ensuring every repair meets strict safety requirements for permanent reliability.</p>

                        <p><strong>Honest Advice:</strong> If a puncture cannot be safely repaired, we'll explain why and provide competitive quotes for replacement tyres. We never compromise on safety for the sake of a repair.</p>

                        <h3>Common Puncture Causes & Prevention</h3>
                        <p>Understanding common puncture causes can help you avoid future problems and maintain your tyres in optimal condition. Most punctures are preventable with proper awareness and tyre maintenance.</p>

                        <ul style="margin-left: 20px; margin-bottom: 1rem;">
                            <li><strong>Road Debris:</strong> Nails, screws, glass, and metal fragments from construction or accidents</li>
                            <li><strong>Sharp Objects:</strong> Industrial debris, thorns, or deliberately placed objects</li>
                            <li><strong>Kerb Damage:</strong> Impact damage from hitting kerbs can cause sidewall punctures</li>
                            <li><strong>Valve Problems:</strong> Damaged or deteriorated valves can cause slow air leaks</li>
                            <li><strong>Age-Related:</strong> Older tyres may develop cracks that allow air to escape</li>
                            <li><strong>Under-inflation:</strong> Low pressure increases puncture risk and causes rapid damage</li>
                        </ul>

                        <p>Regular tyre pressure checks, visual inspections, and careful driving can significantly reduce puncture risk and extend tyre life.</p>

                            <p>No, leave the object in place if the tyre still has air pressure. Removing it will cause rapid deflation and may make the puncture worse. Drive carefully to our garage or call for assistance if the tyre is completely flat.</p>

                            <p>Run-flat tyres generally cannot be safely repaired after being driven on while flat, as this can cause internal structural damage. We'll assess each case individually and advise on the safest option for your specific situation.</p>
