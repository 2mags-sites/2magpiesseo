                        <p>Engine oil is the lifeblood of your vehicle, providing crucial lubrication, cooling, and protection for moving parts. Over time, oil breaks down and becomes contaminated, losing its effectiveness and potentially causing expensive engine damage.</p>

                        <h3>When Do You Need an Oil Change?</h3>
                        <p>Oil change intervals depend on your vehicle type, driving conditions, and oil type used. Modern vehicles with synthetic oils can often go longer between changes, while older vehicles or severe driving conditions may require more frequent service.</p>

                        <ul style="margin-left: 20px; margin-bottom: 1rem;">
                            <li><strong>Time intervals:</strong> Every 3-12 months depending on oil type and driving</li>
                            <li><strong>Mileage intervals:</strong> Every 3,000-10,000 miles based on manufacturer recommendations</li>
                            <li><strong>Severe conditions:</strong> More frequent changes for stop-start traffic, short journeys, or dusty environments</li>
                            <li><strong>Warning signs:</strong> Dark, thick oil, engine noise, or oil level warnings</li>
                            <li><strong>Before long trips:</strong> Fresh oil for peace of mind on extended journeys</li>
                            <li><strong>Seasonal changes:</strong> Different viscosity oils for winter and summer conditions</li>
                        </ul>

                            <p>This depends on your vehicle and driving conditions. Modern cars with synthetic oil can often go 6,000-10,000 miles between changes, while older vehicles or severe driving conditions may need changes every 3,000-5,000 miles. Check your owner's manual for specific recommendations.</p>

                        <div class="faq-answer">
                            <p>Synthetic oil is engineered to provide superior protection, especially in extreme temperatures. It lasts longer, flows better in cold weather, and provides better high-temperature protection. While more expensive initially, synthetic oil often extends change intervals, making it cost-effective long-term.</p>

                        <div class="faq-answer">
                            <p>Yes, you can safely switch between conventional, semi-synthetic, and fully synthetic oils. However, it's best to stick with one type for consistency. If switching, we recommend fully draining the old oil to avoid mixing different formulations.</p>

                        <div class="faq-answer">
                            <p>Yes, we always replace the oil filter with every oil change. The filter removes contaminants from the oil, and a dirty filter can quickly contaminate fresh oil. Using a new filter ensures your new oil stays clean and effective for longer.</p>

                            <p>We responsibly recycle all used oil and filters in compliance with environmental regulations. Used oil can be cleaned and reused, while filters are processed to recover the metal components. This ensures minimal environmental impact from the service.</p>
