                        <h3>When Do You Need an Interim Service?</h3>
                        <p>An interim service is recommended every 6 months or 6,000 miles, whichever comes first. It's particularly important for certain driving conditions and vehicle usage patterns that put extra stress on your car.</p>

                        <ul style="margin-left: 20px; margin-bottom: 1rem;">
                            <li><strong>High mileage drivers:</strong> More than 12,000 miles per year</li>
                            <li><strong>City driving:</strong> Frequent stop-start traffic conditions</li>
                            <li><strong>Short journeys:</strong> Mostly trips under 10 miles</li>
                            <li><strong>Harsh conditions:</strong> Dusty environments or extreme temperatures</li>
                            <li><strong>Older vehicles:</strong> Cars over 5 years old requiring more frequent attention</li>
                            <li><strong>Business use:</strong> Vehicles that cannot afford unexpected breakdowns</li>
                        </ul>

                        <p>Regular interim servicing helps identify potential problems early, extending your vehicle's life and maintaining its reliability.</p>

                        <div class="faq-answer">
                            <p>No, an interim service cannot replace your annual MOT test, which is a legal requirement. However, regular interim servicing helps ensure your vehicle stays in good condition and is more likely to pass its MOT test without issues.</p>

                            <p>We use high-quality engine oils from trusted brands, matched to your vehicle's specific requirements. This includes the correct viscosity grade and specification (conventional, semi-synthetic, or fully synthetic) as recommended by your vehicle manufacturer.</p>
