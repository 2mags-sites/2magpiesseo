                        <h3>Common Class 5 MOT Considerations</h3>
                        <p>Class 5 vehicles face unique challenges due to their size, weight, and passenger-carrying responsibilities. Our experience with minibus and large passenger vehicle testing has identified these common areas of attention:</p>

                        <ul style="margin-left: 20px; margin-bottom: 1rem;">
                            <li><strong>Brake performance:</strong> Enhanced braking requirements due to passenger load and vehicle weight</li>
                            <li><strong>Door mechanisms:</strong> All passenger doors must operate correctly and safely</li>
                            <li><strong>Emergency exits:</strong> Proper function and accessibility of emergency escape routes</li>
                            <li><strong>Seat belt systems:</strong> All passenger restraints must be secure and functional</li>
                            <li><strong>Suspension systems:</strong> Handling additional weight and ensuring passenger comfort</li>
                            <li><strong>Lighting systems:</strong> Enhanced visibility requirements for larger vehicles</li>
                        </ul>

                        <p>Regular maintenance and pre-MOT inspections are particularly important for passenger vehicles to ensure safety and compliance.</p>

                            <p>Yes, we can test motorhomes and converted vehicles that fall under Class 5 requirements. However, the specific test class depends on the vehicle's seating configuration and weight. We'll help determine the correct classification when you book.</p>
