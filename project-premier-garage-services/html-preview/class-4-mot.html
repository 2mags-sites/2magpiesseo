                        <h3>Common Class 4 MOT Failure Points</h3>
                        <p>Understanding the most common reasons why cars fail their Class 4 MOT can help you prepare your vehicle and potentially avoid a failed test. Based on our experience at our Stockport testing centre, these are the most frequent issues:</p>

                        <ul style="margin-left: 20px; margin-bottom: 1rem;">
                            <li><strong>Lighting defects:</strong> Blown bulbs, faulty indicators, or misaligned headlights (33% of failures)</li>
                            <li><strong>Suspension issues:</strong> Worn shock absorbers, damaged springs, or excessive play</li>
                            <li><strong>Brake problems:</strong> Worn pads or discs, brake fluid leaks, or poor performance</li>
                            <li><strong>Tyre issues:</strong> Insufficient tread depth, damage, or incorrect pressures</li>
                            <li><strong>Emissions failures:</strong> Excessive exhaust emissions or faulty catalytic converter</li>
                            <li><strong>Windscreen damage:</strong> Chips or cracks affecting the driver's line of sight</li>
                        </ul>

                        <p>We recommend a pre-MOT check to identify potential issues before your test, potentially saving you time and money.</p>

                            <p>If you drive a standard car, small van, or private vehicle with up to 8 seats and weighing under 3,000kg, you need a Class 4 MOT. This covers about 95% of all vehicles on UK roads. If you're unsure, our team can confirm the correct MOT class when you book.</p>

                        <div class="faq-answer">
                            <p>Class 4 is for standard cars and light vehicles up to 3,000kg with up to 8 seats. Class 5 covers larger passenger vehicles (13+ seats), while Class 7 is for commercial vehicles between 3,000-3,500kg. Class 4 is the most common MOT test type.</p>

                        <div class="faq-answer">
                            <p>A standard Class 4 MOT test takes approximately 45-60 minutes. This includes all required checks and documentation. If minor repairs are needed, we can often complete these on the same day, though this may extend the total time.</p>
