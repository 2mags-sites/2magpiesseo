                        <h3>What is Wheel Alignment?</h3>
                        <p>Wheel alignment, also known as tracking, refers to the adjustment of a vehicle's suspension angles to ensure all wheels are pointing in the correct direction. These precise angles affect how your tyres make contact with the road surface.</p>

                        <p><strong>Key alignment angles we measure and adjust:</strong></p>
                        <ul style="margin-left: 20px; margin-bottom: 1rem;">
                            <li><strong>Toe:</strong> Whether wheels point inward or outward when viewed from above</li>
                            <li><strong>Camber:</strong> Inward or outward tilt of wheels when viewed from front/rear</li>
                            <li><strong>Caster:</strong> Forward or backward tilt of steering axis</li>
                            <li><strong>Thrust angle:</strong> Direction rear wheels point relative to centreline</li>
                            <li><strong>Setback:</strong> Difference in position between left and right wheels</li>
                            <li><strong>Wheelbase:</strong> Distance between front and rear axles</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h3>Signs Your Vehicle Needs Wheel Alignment</h3>
                        <p><strong>Uneven Tyre Wear:</strong> If your tyres are wearing more on one side than the other, or showing irregular wear patterns, this is often a clear sign that your wheels need alignment.</p>

                        <p><strong>Vehicle Pulling:</strong> If your car pulls to one side when driving on straight, level roads, or the steering wheel is off-centre when driving straight, alignment adjustment is needed.</p>

                        <p><strong>Steering Issues:</strong> Vibrating steering wheel, loose steering feel, or difficulty maintaining straight-line driving all indicate potential alignment problems.</p>

                        <p><strong>After Impact:</strong> Following pot hole damage, kerb strikes, or minor collisions, wheel alignment should be checked as these impacts can knock wheels out of alignment.</p>
