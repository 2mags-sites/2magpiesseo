                        <h3>Signs Your Vehicle Needs Alignment</h3>
                        <p><strong>Uneven Tyre Wear:</strong> Excessive wear on one edge of the tyre, or different wear patterns between left and right tyres are clear indicators of alignment problems that need immediate attention.</p>

                        <p><strong>Vehicle Pulling:</strong> If your vehicle pulls to one side when driving straight, or you need to hold the steering wheel at an angle to maintain straight-line driving, alignment adjustment is needed.</p>

                        <p><strong>Steering Issues:</strong> Vibration in the steering wheel, loose or wandering steering feel, or steering wheel not returning to center after cornering all indicate alignment problems.</p>

                        <p><strong>After Impact:</strong> Any impact with kerbs, potholes, or accidents can knock wheels out of alignment. Regular alignment checks help identify problems before they cause expensive tyre damage.</p>

                        <h3>Understanding Alignment Angles</h3>
                        <p>Modern vehicles have complex suspension geometry with multiple angles that work together to provide optimal handling, tyre wear, and stability. Understanding these angles helps explain why proper alignment is so important.</p>

                        <ul style="margin-left: 20px; margin-bottom: 1rem;">
                            <li><strong>Toe:</strong> Whether wheels point inward or outward affects tyre wear and straight-line stability</li>
                            <li><strong>Camber:</strong> Inward or outward tilt of wheels affects cornering grip and tyre contact patch</li>
                            <li><strong>Caster:</strong> Forward or backward tilt of steering axis affects stability and steering return</li>
                            <li><strong>Thrust Angle:</strong> Rear axle alignment relative to vehicle centerline affects tracking</li>
                            <li><strong>SAI:</strong> Steering Axis Inclination affects steering feel and wheel return characteristics</li>
                            <li><strong>Included Angle:</strong> Combination of camber and SAI indicating potential suspension damage</li>
                        </ul>

                        <p>Our computerized alignment system measures all these angles precisely and compares them to your vehicle's specific manufacturer settings.</p>

                            <p>Alignment can fix vibration caused by misaligned wheels, but vibration can also be caused by wheel balancing issues, worn suspension components, or warped brake discs. We'll diagnose the exact cause and recommend the appropriate solution.</p>

                            <p>While not always essential, alignment after new tyres ensures maximum tyre life and optimal performance. If your old tyres showed uneven wear, alignment is definitely recommended to prevent the same problem with new tyres.</p>

                            <p>If alignment cannot be achieved, it usually indicates worn suspension components that need replacement first. We'll provide a detailed report showing what needs attention and quote for any necessary repairs before alignment.</p>
