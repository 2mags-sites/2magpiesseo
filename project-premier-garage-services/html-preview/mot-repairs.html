                            <p>MOT failures are categorised to help you understand their severity and urgency:</p>
                            <ul style="margin-left: 20px; margin-bottom: 1rem;">
                                <li><strong>Dangerous defects:</strong> Vehicle cannot be driven until repaired</li>

                            <p>We help you prioritise repairs based on safety and legal requirements. Dangerous and major defects must be fixed before your vehicle can pass its retest, while minor defects can often wait until your next service or MOT.</p>

                            <p>You have 10 working days from your MOT test to complete repairs and return for a free retest. If you come back within this timeframe, you'll only need a partial retest focusing on the items that were repaired, not a full MOT test.</p>

                            <p>This depends on the type of failure. If your vehicle has 'dangerous' defects, it cannot be driven at all.

                            <p>You must repair all 'dangerous' and 'major' defects for your vehicle to pass its MOT retest. 'Minor' defects (advisories) don't prevent your vehicle from passing, but we recommend addressing them to prevent future problems.</p>
