                        <h3>Signs Your Suspension Needs Repair</h3>
                        <p><strong>Excessive Bouncing:</strong> If your vehicle continues to bounce after going over bumps or feels unstable when cornering, your shock absorbers may be worn and need replacement.</p>

                        <p><strong>Uneven Tyre Wear:</strong> Worn suspension components can cause irregular tyre wear patterns, leading to premature tyre replacement and compromised safety.</p>

                        <p><strong>Vehicle Pulling:</strong> If your car pulls to one side while driving or the steering wheel is off-centre, this could indicate worn suspension bushes or alignment issues.</p>

                        <p><strong>Clunking Noises:</strong> Strange noises when going over bumps or turning corners often indicate worn suspension components that require immediate attention.</p>

                            <li><strong>Check tyre wear:</strong> Monitor tyre wear patterns as indicators of suspension problems</li>
                            <li><strong>Avoid potholes:</strong> Where safe to do so, avoid large potholes and road hazards</li>
                            <li><strong>Load awareness:</strong> Don't exceed your vehicle's maximum weight capacity</li>
                            <li><strong>Listen for noises:</strong> Pay attention to unusual sounds when driving over bumps</li>
                            <li><strong>Professional servicing:</strong> Use qualified technicians for suspension work</li>

                            <p>Driving with worn suspension is dangerous and can affect your vehicle's MOT test. Faulty suspension can increase stopping distances by up to 20% and significantly reduce your control over the vehicle, especially in emergency situations.</p>

                            <p>We recommend having your suspension checked annually during your service or if you notice any changes in your vehicle's handling characteristics. Early intervention can prevent more expensive repairs and ensure your safety.</p>

                            <p>Common signs include excessive bouncing over bumps, uneven tyre wear, the vehicle pulling to one side, clunking noises from the suspension, or a general feeling that the car is not handling as well as it used to.

                            <p>Yes, we generally recommend replacing suspension components in pairs (both sides) to maintain balanced handling and prevent premature wear of the new component. This ensures your vehicle handles predictably and safely.</p>
