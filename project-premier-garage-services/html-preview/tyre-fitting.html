                            <p>Yes, we have the equipment and expertise to handle Tyre Pressure Monitoring System (TPMS) sensors. We can transfer existing sensors to new tyres and reprogram the system as required. Additional charges may apply for TPMS services.</p>

                            <p>We dispose of old tyres responsibly through licensed waste carriers in accordance with environmental regulations. The disposal cost is included in our fitting service, and tyres are recycled or processed for other uses rather than going to landfill.</p>
