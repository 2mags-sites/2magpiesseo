                        <p><strong>Affordability:</strong> Budget tyres provide essential safety and performance at a fraction of the cost of premium brands, making them perfect when budget is the primary concern.</p>

                        <p><strong>Reliability:</strong> While not offering premium features, budget tyres provide dependable performance for regular driving conditions and are ideal for older vehicles or temporary replacements.</p>

                        <p>Budget tyres are an excellent choice in many situations where cost is the primary factor but safety cannot be compromised. Understanding when budget tyres are appropriate helps you make the right decision.</p>

                        <ul style="margin-left: 20px; margin-bottom: 1rem;">
                            <li><strong>Older Vehicles:</strong> When the car's value doesn't justify expensive premium tyres</li>
                            <li><strong>Low Mileage:</strong> For vehicles doing less than 8,000 miles per year</li>
                            <li><strong>City Driving:</strong> Mainly urban driving with lower speeds and stop-start traffic</li>
                            <li><strong>Temporary Solutions:</strong> Short-term replacement before vehicle upgrade or disposal</li>
                            <li><strong>Emergency Replacement:</strong> When immediate replacement is needed on a tight budget</li>
                            <li><strong>Spare Vehicles:</strong> Second cars, learner vehicles, or infrequently used vehicles</li>

                            <h3>Getting the Most from Budget Tyres</h3>
                            <p>While budget tyres cost less initially, proper care can significantly extend their life and improve value:</p>
                            <ul style="margin-left: 20px; margin-bottom: 1rem;">
                                <li><strong>Correct Pressure:</strong> Check monthly to prevent premature wear and improve fuel economy</li>
                                <li><strong>Gentle Driving:</strong> Avoid harsh acceleration, braking, and cornering to extend tyre life</li>
                                <li><strong>Regular Rotation:</strong> Rotate tyres every 5,000 miles for even wear patterns</li>
                                <li><strong>Alignment Checks:</strong> Annual alignment checks prevent uneven wear and early replacement</li>
                            </ul>

                            <h3>Safety Considerations</h3>
                            <p>Important safety points for budget tyre users:</p>
                            <ul style="margin-left: 20px; margin-bottom: 1rem;">
                                <li>Replace at 3mm tread depth (not legal minimum 1.6mm) for better safety margin</li>
                                <li>Check for damage more frequently as budget tyres may be less robust</li>
                                <li>Consider upgrading if doing high-speed motorway driving regularly</li>
                                <li>Monitor performance and replace if handling feels compromised</li>
                            </ul>

                            <p>Yes, all our budget tyres meet UK and European safety standards (ECE regulations) and are perfectly safe for regular driving. They must pass the same basic safety tests as premium tyres, including wet grip and rolling resistance standards.</p>

                            <p>Budget tyres typically last 15,000-25,000 miles depending on driving style and conditions. While they may not last as long as premium tyres, their low cost often makes them excellent value for money, especially for low-mileage drivers.</p>

                        <div class="faq-answer">
                            <p>Budget tyres meet safety standards but may have simpler tread patterns, basic rubber compounds, and fewer advanced features. Premium tyres offer better wet grip, fuel economy, noise levels, and longevity, but cost significantly more upfront.</p>

                            <p>While technically possible, we recommend replacing tyres in pairs (both front or both rear) for optimal handling and safety. Mixing very different tyre types can affect vehicle stability, so we'll advise the best approach for your specific situation.</p>

                            <p>Yes, our budget tyres come with manufacturer warranties against defects, typically 12-24 months. While shorter than premium tyre warranties, they still provide protection against manufacturing faults and premature failure due to defects.</p>
