                        <p><strong>Reduced Cooling:</strong> If your AC is not cooling as effectively as it used to, or takes longer to reach the desired temperature, it may need servicing or repair.</p>

                        <p><strong>Strange Noises:</strong> Unusual sounds when the AC is running, such as grinding, squealing, or clicking noises, often indicate component problems that need professional attention.</p>

                        <p><strong>Unpleasant Odours:</strong> Musty or unusual smells from your AC system can indicate mould growth or other issues that require cleaning and maintenance.</p>

                        <p><strong>Visible Leaks:</strong> Puddles of coolant under your vehicle or visible refrigerant leaks indicate system damage that needs immediate professional repair.</p>

                            <p>We take environmental responsibility seriously when servicing AC systems:</p>
                            <ul style="margin-left: 20px; margin-bottom: 1rem;">
                                <li>Safe recovery and recycling of old refrigerants</li>

                            <p>A well-maintained AC system not only provides comfort but also improves fuel efficiency. A faulty AC system can increase fuel consumption by up to 20%, especially during summer months when the system works hardest.</p>

                            <p>We recommend having your AC system serviced annually, ideally before the summer season. This ensures optimal performance when you need it most and helps identify potential issues before they become expensive problems.</p>

                            <p>Poor cooling can be caused by several factors including low refrigerant levels, compressor problems, blocked condensers, or faulty temperature sensors. Our diagnostic service can identify the exact cause and recommend the appropriate solution.</p>

                            <p>R1234yf is the newer, more environmentally friendly refrigerant used in vehicles manufactured after 2017. R134a is the older refrigerant still used in many vehicles. We can service both types and will use the correct refrigerant for your specific vehicle.</p>

                            <p>Yes, and we actually recommend running your AC system briefly each week throughout the year. This keeps the system lubricated, prevents seals from drying out, and helps clear condensation from windows more effectively.</p>
