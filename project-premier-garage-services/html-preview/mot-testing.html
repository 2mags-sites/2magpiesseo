                        <h3>MOT Classes We Test</h3>
                        <p><strong>Class 4 MOT:</strong> The most common MOT test, covering cars, private hire vehicles, and passenger vehicles with up to 8 seats. This includes most family cars, small vans, and motorhomes under 3,000kg.</p>

                        <p><strong>Class 5 MOT:</strong> For private passenger vehicles with 13 or more seats, including minibuses and larger motorhomes. These vehicles require additional safety checks due to their passenger-carrying capacity.</p>

                        <p><strong>Class 7 MOT:</strong> Commercial vehicles between 3,000kg and 3,500kg, including larger vans and small trucks. These tests include additional checks on loading areas and commercial vehicle specific requirements.</p>

                        <p>Not sure which class your vehicle falls under? Our friendly team can help identify the correct MOT class for your vehicle when you book.</p>

                        <p>Understanding common MOT failure points can help you prepare your vehicle for its test. The most frequent reasons vehicles fail their MOT in our Stockport testing centre include:</p>

                        <ul style="margin-left: 20px; margin-bottom: 1rem;">
                            <li><strong>Lights and signalling:</strong> Blown bulbs, faulty indicators, or misaligned headlights</li>
                            <li><strong>Suspension:</strong> Worn shock absorbers or damaged springs</li>
                            <li><strong>Brakes:</strong> Worn brake pads, discs, or low brake fluid</li>
                            <li><strong>Tyres:</strong> Insufficient tread depth (below 1.6mm) or damage</li>
                            <li><strong>Windscreen:</strong> Chips or cracks in the driver's line of sight</li>
                            <li><strong>Emissions:</strong> Excessive exhaust emissions or catalytic converter issues</li>
                        </ul>

                        <p>We offer pre-MOT checks to identify and fix potential issues before your official test, saving you time and avoiding the inconvenience of a failed MOT.</p>

                            <ul style="margin-left: 20px; margin-bottom: 1rem;">
                                <li>Your vehicle registration document (V5C)</li>

                            <h3>When is Your MOT Due?</h3>
                            <p>Your first MOT is due when your vehicle is 3 years old, then annually thereafter. You can have your MOT test done up to one month before it expires without losing any time on your current certificate. We recommend booking early to avoid any last-minute rush and ensure you get a convenient appointment slot.</p>

                            <p>Driving without a valid MOT certificate is illegal and can result in a fine of up to £1,000. It also invalidates your insurance, potentially leaving you personally liable for any accidents.</p>
