                        <h3>R134a vs R1234yf Refrigerants</h3>
                        <p><strong>R134a Refrigerant:</strong> Used in vehicles manufactured before 2017. This is the traditional refrigerant that has been widely used for many years and is still perfectly safe and effective.</p>

                        <p><strong>R1234yf Refrigerant:</strong> The newer, more environmentally friendly refrigerant used in vehicles manufactured from 2017 onwards. It has a much lower global warming potential than R134a.</p>

                        <p><strong>Identification:</strong> We can identify which refrigerant your vehicle uses by checking the year of manufacture, VIN number, and system labels. Using the wrong refrigerant can damage your AC system.</p>

                        <p><strong>Cost Difference:</strong> R1234yf is more expensive than R134a due to its newer technology and environmental benefits, but both provide excellent cooling performance.</p>

                        <h3>Signs Your AC Needs Regas</h3>
                        <p>Recognising when your air conditioning system needs a regas can help you maintain optimal cooling performance and prevent more expensive repairs:</p>

                        <ul style="margin-left: 20px; margin-bottom: 1rem;">
                            <li><strong>Reduced cooling:</strong> AC takes longer to cool or doesn't reach desired temperature</li>
                            <li><strong>Warm air:</strong> Air from vents is not as cold as it used to be</li>
                            <li><strong>Frequent cycling:</strong> AC compressor turns on and off more frequently</li>
                            <li><strong>Increased fuel consumption:</strong> AC system working harder to achieve cooling</li>
                            <li><strong>Ice formation:</strong> Ice appearing on AC components outside the vehicle</li>
                            <li><strong>Time-based:</strong> It's been 2+ years since your last regas service</li>
                        </ul>

                        <p>We recommend having your AC system recharged every 2-3 years as part of regular maintenance, even if you haven't noticed performance issues.</p>
