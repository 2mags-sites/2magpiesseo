                        <p>Proper tyre maintenance is crucial for safety, performance, and longevity. We provide expert advice on maintaining your tyres and help you understand when replacement is necessary.</p>

                        <p><strong>Key safety considerations:</strong></p>
                        <ul style="margin-left: 20px; margin-bottom: 1rem;">
                            <li><strong>Tread Depth:</strong> Legal minimum is 1.6mm, but 3mm recommended for safety</li>
                            <li><strong>Tyre Pressure:</strong> Check monthly and before long journeys</li>
                            <li><strong>Visual Inspection:</strong> Look for cuts, bulges, uneven wear, or embedded objects</li>
                            <li><strong>Age Considerations:</strong> Tyres over 6 years old should be inspected annually</li>
                            <li><strong>Rotation Service:</strong> Regular rotation promotes even wear and extends life</li>
                            <li><strong>Alignment Check:</strong> Proper alignment prevents premature wear</li>
                        </ul>

                            <p>Our tyre prices start from £45 including fitting, balancing, and disposal. The exact cost depends on your vehicle's tyre size and the brand you choose. We offer budget, mid-range, and premium options to suit all budgets and requirements.</p>

                            <p>Standard tyre fitting typically takes 30-45 minutes per tyre, including removal, fitting, balancing, and pressure setting. A complete set of four tyres usually takes 2-3 hours. We can often complete the work while you wait.</p>

                            <p>We can repair most punctures in the central tread area of the tyre, provided the damage is within safety guidelines. Punctures in the sidewall, shoulder area, or those larger than 6mm diameter typically require tyre replacement for safety reasons.</p>
