                        <h3>Signs Your Clutch Needs Replacement</h3>
                        <p><strong>Slipping Clutch:</strong> If your engine revs increase but vehicle speed doesn't match, or you notice a burning smell, your clutch is likely slipping and needs replacement.</p>

                        <p><strong>Difficulty Changing Gears:</strong> Hard gear changes, grinding noises, or the clutch pedal feeling spongy or sticking can indicate clutch or hydraulic system problems.</p>

                        <p><strong>Clutch Judder:</strong> Vibration through the clutch pedal or vehicle shaking when moving off indicates worn clutch components or flywheel problems.</p>

                        <p><strong>High Clutch Bite Point:</strong> If the clutch engages very high up on the pedal travel, or the pedal feels heavy, this often indicates clutch wear requiring attention.</p>

                        <h3>Clutch Maintenance Tips</h3>
                        <p>Proper clutch operation can significantly extend clutch life and save you money on premature replacement. Here are our expert recommendations for maintaining your clutch system:</p>

                        <ul style="margin-left: 20px; margin-bottom: 1rem;">
                            <li><strong>Avoid riding the clutch:</strong> Don't rest your foot on the clutch pedal while driving</li>
                            <li><strong>Complete pedal depression:</strong> Always press the clutch pedal fully when changing gears</li>
                            <li><strong>Smooth gear changes:</strong> Change gears smoothly without forcing or rushing</li>
                            <li><strong>Use handbrake on hills:</strong> Don't use clutch slip to hold position on inclines</li>
                            <li><strong>Warm up gently:</strong> Allow the clutch to warm up before demanding full performance</li>
                            <li><strong>Regular servicing:</strong> Have clutch operation checked during regular services</li>
                        </ul>

                        <p>Good clutch driving technique can extend clutch life from 60,000 miles to over 100,000 miles, making proper technique a worthwhile investment.</p>

                            <p>Common signs include clutch slipping (engine revs without speed increase), difficulty changing gears, burning smell, clutch judder, or a very high bite point. If you notice any of these symptoms, book a diagnostic inspection.</p>

                            <p>Clutch replacement typically takes 4-8 hours depending on the vehicle type and complexity. Some vehicles with difficult access may take longer. We'll provide an accurate time estimate when quoting for your specific vehicle.</p>

                            <p>A quality clutch kit should last 60,000-100,000 miles with normal driving. Clutch life depends heavily on driving style, with city driving and heavy traffic reducing lifespan significantly compared to highway driving.</p>

                            <p>We inspect the flywheel during every clutch replacement. If it's worn or damaged, we'll recommend replacement or machining. On dual mass flywheel vehicles, replacement is often necessary and cost-effective when doing the clutch.</p>

                            <p>You should avoid driving with a slipping clutch as it can cause expensive damage to the flywheel and other components. A slipping clutch will also leave you stranded when it fails completely. Book urgent repairs if your clutch is slipping.</p>
