                        <h3>Signs Your Brakes Need Attention</h3>
                        <p><strong>Squealing or Grinding:</strong> High-pitched squealing or metal-on-metal grinding sounds indicate worn brake pads that need immediate replacement to prevent disc damage.</p>

                        <p><strong>Increased Stopping Distance:</strong> If your vehicle takes longer to stop or requires more pressure on the brake pedal, this indicates worn brake components that need inspection.</p>

                        <p><strong>Vibration or Pulsing:</strong> Vibration through the brake pedal or steering wheel during braking often indicates warped brake discs that require replacement or machining.</p>

                        <p><strong>Pulling to One Side:</strong> If your vehicle pulls to one side when braking, this could indicate uneven brake wear, stuck calipers, or brake fluid contamination.</p>

                        <h3>Brake Maintenance Tips</h3>
                        <p>Proper brake maintenance can extend component life and ensure optimal safety. Here are our expert recommendations for maintaining your vehicle's braking system:</p>

                        <ul style="margin-left: 20px; margin-bottom: 1rem;">
                            <li><strong>Regular inspections:</strong> Have brakes checked during every service and MOT</li>
                            <li><strong>Gentle braking:</strong> Avoid harsh braking where possible to reduce wear</li>
                            <li><strong>Brake fluid changes:</strong> Replace brake fluid every 2-3 years to prevent contamination</li>
                            <li><strong>Listen for noises:</strong> Address brake noises immediately to prevent expensive damage</li>
                            <li><strong>Check warning lights:</strong> Never ignore brake warning lights on your dashboard</li>
                            <li><strong>Handbrake use:</strong> Use your handbrake regularly to prevent seizure</li>
                        </ul>

                        <p>Early brake maintenance is not only safer but also more cost-effective than waiting for complete brake failure, which can cause expensive damage to discs and other components.</p>

                            <p>Warning signs include squealing or grinding noises, increased stopping distances, vibration during braking, or the brake warning light. We recommend having brakes inspected if you notice any of these symptoms.</p>
