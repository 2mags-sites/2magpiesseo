                        <h3>Common Class 7 MOT Considerations</h3>
                        <p>Commercial vehicles face unique challenges due to their heavy-duty use, loading requirements, and business-critical operations. Our experience with Class 7 testing has identified these common areas requiring attention:</p>

                        <ul style="margin-left: 20px; margin-bottom: 1rem;">
                            <li><strong>Brake systems:</strong> Enhanced performance requirements due to maximum loaded weight</li>
                            <li><strong>Suspension wear:</strong> Heavy loading can accelerate wear on springs and shock absorbers</li>
                            <li><strong>Tyre condition:</strong> Commercial use often leads to irregular wear patterns and damage</li>
                            <li><strong>Loading equipment:</strong> Tailgates, ramps, and securing points must be safe and functional</li>
                            <li><strong>Bodywork integrity:</strong> Loading damage and corrosion from commercial use</li>
                            <li><strong>Lighting systems:</strong> Work lights and enhanced visibility requirements</li>
                        </ul>

                        <p>Regular maintenance schedules are crucial for commercial vehicles to avoid unexpected failures and business disruption.</p>
