                            <h3>What Are Fault Codes?</h3>
                            <p>Engine diagnostic codes (DTCs - Diagnostic Trouble Codes) are alphanumeric codes that help identify specific problems:</p>
                            <ul style="margin-left: 20px; margin-bottom: 1rem;">
                                <li>P-codes: Powertrain (engine and transmission)</li>
                                <li>B-codes: Body systems (lighting, heating, etc.)</li>
                                <li>C-codes: Chassis systems (brakes, suspension)</li>
